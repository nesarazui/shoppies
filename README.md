# The Shoppies

An application that allows a user to search for movies by title using the OMDB API. The search results dynamically change depending on what the user has typed into the search bar. 

A user can add up to five movies to their nomination list, and has the option to remove any movie from the list. Once five movies have been added to the list an alert appears and any further nominations are disabled.
